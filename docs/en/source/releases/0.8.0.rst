Major changes
--------------------------------------------------------

Improvements to serving framework API
================================================================
The `furiosa-serving <https://github.com/furiosa-ai/furiosa-sdk/tree/branch-0.8.0/python/furiosa-serving>`_
is a FastAPI-based serving framework.
With the `furiosa-serving <https://github.com/furiosa-ai/furiosa-sdk/tree/branch-0.8.0/python/furiosa-serving>`_,
users can quickly develop Python-based high performance web service applications that utilize NPUs.
The 0.8.0 release includes the following major updates.

**Session pool that enables model serving with multiple NPUs**

Session pools improve significantly throughput of model APIs by using multiple NPUs. If large inputs can be divided
into a number of small inputs, this improvement can be used to reduce the latency of serving applications.

.. code-block:: python

    model: NPUServeModel = synchronous(serve.model("nux"))(
        "MNIST",
        location="./assets/models/MNISTnet_uint8_quant_without_softmax.tflite",
        # Specify multiple devices
        npu_device="npu0pe0,npu0pe1,npu1pe0"
        worker_num=4,
    )

**Shift from thread-based to asyncio-based NPU query processing**

Small and frequent NPU inference queries may now be processed with lower latency.
As shown in the example below, applications requiring multiple NPU inferences in a
single API query can be processed with better performance.

.. code-block:: python

    async def inference(self, tensors: List[np.ndarray]) -> List[np.ndarray]:
        # The following code runs multiple inferences at the same time and wait until all requests are completed.
        return await asyncio.gather(*(self.model.predict(tensor) for tensor in tensors))

**Added expanded support for external device & runtime**

In complex serving scenarios, additional/external device and runtime programs may be
required, in addition to NPU-based Furiosa Runtime. In this release, the framework
has been expanded such that external device and runtime may be used. The first
external runtime added is OpenVINO.

.. code-block:: python

    imagenet: ServeModel = synchronous(serve.model("openvino"))(
        'imagenet',
        location='./examples/assets/models/image_classification.onnx'
    )

**Support for S3 cloud storage repository**

Set model ``location`` as S3 URL.

.. code-block:: python

    # Load model from S3 (Auth environment variable for aioboto library required)
    densenet: ServeModel = synchronous(serve.model("nux"))(
        'imagenet',
     location='s3://furiosa/models/93d63f654f0f192cc4ff5691be60fb9379e9d7fd'
    )

**Support for OpenTelemetry compatible tracing**

With the `OpenTelemetry Collector <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/>`_
function, you can now track the execution time of specific code sections of the
serving applications.

To use this function, you can activate ``trace.get_tracer()``, reset the tracer,
activate the ``tracer.start_as_current_span()`` function, and designate the section.

.. code-block:: python

    from opentelemetry import trace

    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

    class Application:

            async def process(self, image: Image.Image) -> int:
                with tracer.start_as_current_span("preprocess"):
                    input_tensors = self.preprocess(image)
                with tracer.start_as_current_span("inference"):
                    output_tensors = await self.inference(input_tensors)
                with tracer.start_as_current_span("postprocess"):
                    return self.postprocess(output_tensors)


The specification of `OpenTelemetry Collector <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/>`_
can be done through the configuration of ``FURIOSA_SERVING_OTLP_ENDPOINT``, as shown below.
The following diagram is an example that visualizes the tracing result with Grafana.

.. code-block::sh

    ``export FURIOSA_SERVING_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://jaeger-collector:4317"``


.. image:: ../../../imgs/jaeger_grafana.png

Other major improvements are as follows:

* Several inference requests can be executed at once, with serving API now supporting compiler setting ``batch_size``
* More threads can share the NPU, with serving API now supporting session option ``worker_num``

Profiler
================================================================
You can now analyze the profiler tracing results with `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
a data analysis framework. With this function, you can analyze the tracing result data,
allowing you to quickly identify bottlenecks and reasons for model performance changes.
More detailed instructions can be found at :ref:`PandasProfilingAnalysis`.

.. code-block:: python

    from furiosa.runtime import session, tensor
    from furiosa.runtime.profiler import RecordFormat, profile

    with profile(format=RecordFormat.PandasDataFrame) as profiler:
        with session.create("MNISTnet_uint8_quant_without_softmax.tflite") as sess:
            input_shape = sess.input(0)

            with profiler.record("record") as record:
                for _ in range(0, 2):
                    sess.run(tensor.rand(input_shape))

    df = profiler.get_pandas_dataframe()
    print(df[df["name"] == "trace"][["trace_id", "name", "thread.id", "dur"]])


Quantization tool
================================================================
:ref:`ModelQuantization` is a tool that converts pre-trained models to quantized models.
This release includes the following major updates.

* Accuracy improvement when processing SiLU operator
* Improved usability of compiler setting ``without_quantize``
* Accuracy improvement when processing MatMul/Gemm operators
* Accuracy improvement when processing Add/Sub/Mul/Div operators
* NPU acceleration now added for more auto_pad properties, when processing Conv/ConvTranspose/MaxPool operators
* NPU acceleration support for PRelu operator

furiosa-toolkit
================================================================
The ``furiosactl`` command line tool, which has been added to the
furiosa-toolkit 0.10.0 release, includes the following improvements.

The newly added `furiosactl ps` command allows you to print
the OS processes which are occupying the NPU device.

.. code-block::

    # furiosactl ps
    +-----------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
    | NPU       | PID    | CMD                                                        |
    +-----------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------+
    | npu0pe0-1 | 132529 | /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/uvicorn image_classify:app |
    +-----------+--------+------------------------------------------------------------+

The `furiosactl info` command now prints the unique UUID for each device.

.. code-block::

    $ furiosactl info
    +------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+--------+--------------+---------+
    | NPU  | Name   | UUID                                 | Firmware        | Temp. | Power  | PCI-BDF      | PCI-DEV |
    +------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+--------+--------------+---------+
    | npu0 | warboy | 72212674-61BE-4FCA-A2C9-555E4EE67AB5 | v1.1.0, 12180b0 |  49°C | 3.12 W | 0000:24:00.0 | 235:0   |
    +------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+--------+--------------+---------+
    | npu1 | warboy | DF80FB54-8190-44BC-B9FB-664FA36C754A | v1.1.0, 12180b0 |  54°C | 2.53 W | 0000:6d:00.0 | 511:0   |
    +------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------------+-------+--------+--------------+---------+

          from furiosa.models.vision import ResNet50

          resnet50: Model = asyncio.run(ResNet50.load_async())


The model post-processing process converts the inference ouput tensor into structural
data, which is more accessible for the application. Depending on the model, this
may require a longer execution time.
The 0.8.0 release includes native post-processing code for ResNet50, SSD-MobileNet,
and SSD-ResNet34. Based on internal benchmarks, native post-processing code can reduce
latency by up to 70%, depending on the model.

The following is a complete example of ResNet50, utilizing native post-processing code.
More information can be found at `Pre/Postprocessing <https://furiosa-ai.github.io/furiosa-models/v0.8.0/model_object/#prepostprocessing>`_.

    .. code-block:: python

        from furiosa.models.vision import ResNet50
        from furiosa.models.vision.resnet50 import NativePostProcessor, preprocess
        from furiosa.runtime import session

        model = ResNet50.load()

        postprocessor = NativePostProcessor(model)
        with session.create(model) as sess:
            image = preprocess("tests/assets/cat.jpg")
            output = sess.run(image).numpy()
            postprocessor.eval(output)
