C SDK installation and user guide
*********************************************************

We explain here how to write FuriosaAI NPU applications using C programming language.
The C SDK provides a C ABI-based static library and C header file. Using these, you can write applications in C, C++, or other languages that support C ABI.

The provided C SDK is relatively lower-level than :ref:`Python SDK <PythonSDK>`. It can be used when lower latency and higher performance are required, or when Python runtime cannot be used.

===================================

The minimum requirements for C SDK are as follows.

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Debian bullseye) or higher

In order to install and use C SDK, you must install the driver, firmware, and runtime library in accordance with
